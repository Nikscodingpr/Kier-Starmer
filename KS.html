<p>It is no secret that the UK is ready for <em>real change</em>, but has Kier Starmer got what it takes to be the next Prime Minister? His recent actions, and indecisiveness have not worked in his favour. The population, including many Labour party members have a lots of questions, and he has a lot to answer for:</p> <br>
<ul> 
<li> Why did he delay the decision on Diane Abbott for so long? </li>
<li> Why did he treat the popular Labour MP for Woodford Green so poorly, unseating her by email?</li>
<li> Why is he not raising taxes, and instead pledging to replicate so many of the Tories policies?</li>
<br>
<h2>Can Kier Starmer grab the countries atention?</h2>
<br>
<p>We know how Boris Johnson captured the public's attention. But does Kier Starmer have what it takes? Or will he continue to be known as <em>boring</em> where people will <strong>fall asleep</strong> listening to him?</p>
